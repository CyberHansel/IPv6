1. Device connects to IPv6 network and first automatically generates a link-local address by EUI-64 or random. On device you can chose, but often be configured in the device’s network settings.
2. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), After generating a link-local address, the node sends a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message to FF02::1 to discover other devices on the local link.
3. Any device that receives the NS message and recognizes its own address responds with a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message that includes its link-layer MAC address.
4. Before finalizing its link-local address, the node performs Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). It sends NS message (to FF02::1) if any other device is using same address.
5. Device automatically joins certain multicast groups, example: all-nodes multicast group (FF02::1) 
6. Device sends Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)messages to router to formally express its interest in specific multicast groups, so message indicates, that device wants to receive packets sent to that multicast group.
7. Router Solicitation (RS): If the node needs to obtain additional configuration information (like default gateway settings), it sends a Router Solicitation (RS) message to the multicast address FF02::2 (all-routers).
8. Router Advertisement (RA): Routers on the local link respond with Router Advertisement (RA) messages, providing necessary configuration details.
This may include the IPv6 prefix for the network, default gateway, and other parameters.

SOLUTION TO ATTACK

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IPV6 BASIC HEADERS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


1. threat IP spoofing           -Changing IPv6 header Source Address field or IP spoofing. 
SOLUTION - Ingress Filtering [RFC2827 / BCP38(opens in a new tab)] and unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704 / BCP84(opens in a new tab)]. These techniques filter packets received by a router based on their source address, denying packets that come from addresses not to be used on that network.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. threat Covert channel        - A Covert channel is a type of attack that allows the transfer of information between two network nodes that are not allowed to communicate. In IPv6, the basic headers can be used to create a covert channel sending information within Traffic Class (8 bits) and/or Flow Label (20 bits) fields.  For example, a PDF file can be divided into 28 bits pieces and sent packet by packet to a ready to receive destination, which will put all the pieces together and make the PDF file available in the receiving node.
SOLUTION  -  Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can be used to inspect packets. This allows you to inspect traffic and detect unusual or unexpected values in some fields, like for example the values in the flow label, which is expected to be 0 (zero).


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IPV6 EXTENSION HEADERS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


1. threat Routing Header type 0, RH0 -Do not use RH0 or do not allow the use of it. This can be achieved by ensuring that your IPv6 nodes follow RFC5095(opens in a new tab), i.e., the support for RH0 is removed. Extra operational measures can be used: Ingress filtering at the site border, and firewall policies that filter packets using RH0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. threat Bypassing RA Filtering/RA-Guard using any Extension Header      -One possible malicious use of EHs is adding an EH where it is not supposed to be used. For example, if you tailor make an IPv6 packet by adding a Destination Option EH before the ICMPv6 RA message, the mechanisms that filter rogue RAs, like the RA-Guard mechanism, could fail. "While there is currently no legitimate use for IPv6 Extension Headers in ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages, Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861(opens in a new tab)] implementations allow the use of Extension Headers with these messages, by simply ignoring the received options. Some RA-Guard implementations try to identify ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages by simply looking at the "Next Header" field of the fixed IPv6 header, rather than following the entire header chain. As a result, such implementations fail to identify any ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages that include any Extension Headers (for example, a Hop-by-Hop Options header, a Destination Options header, etc.), and can be easily circumvented."
SOLUTION - The solution is for your security tools to inspect the IPv6 header chain properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. threat Bypassing RA Filtering/RA-Guard using Fragment Extension Header       -attack uses the Fragment header. It depends on the security devices/software putting all fragments together to understand what packet is being sent. This is not easy to do as mechanisms like RA-Guard are implemented in layer 2 devices (switches). Security devices/software need all fragments to detect the RA.
SOLUTION - Avoiding attacks using fragmented NDP packets is simple: Do not use them and do not allow them to be used. This can be achieved by ensuring that your IPv6 nodes follow RFC6980 (opens in a new tab)which forbids fragmented NDP packets. Extra operational measures include using firewall policies to filter fragmented NDP. The protection can be made more generic by enforcing RFC7112 (opens in a new tab)so the IPv6 header chain should always go in the first fragment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. threat Overlapping fragments      -Some OS do not properly handle fragments that overlap in this manner. This is the basis for the teardrop attack. Overlapping fragments may also be used in an attempt to bypass Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This is where part of an attack is sent in fragments along with additional random data. Future fragments may overwrite the random data with the remainder of the attack. If the completed datagram is not properly reassembled at the IDS, the attack will go undetected.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzRODkHDUgw
SOLUTION - When reassembling an IPv6 datagram, if one or more of its fragments are overlapping, the entire datagram (and any other fragments, including those not yet received) must be silently discarded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. threat Not sending last fragment (DOS)       -In this case there's resource consumption on the destination host, which keeps waiting for the last fragment to put all parts together. This happens while using memory to store the received parts of the fragmented packet. If many of these unfinished fragmented packets are received it could cause memory exhaustion and stop any other communication.
SOLUTION - The IPv6 standard establishes a timeout mechanism with a default timer of 60 seconds: “If insufficient fragments are received to complete reassembly of a packet within 60 seconds of the reception of the first-arriving fragment of that packet, reassembly of that packet must be abandoned and all the fragments that have been received for that packet must be discarded.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. threat "Atomic" fragments      -IPv6 atomic fragments are IPv6 packets that contain a Fragment Header with the fragment offset set to 0 and the M flag set to 0. In other words, it is an IPv6 packet that is fragmented into only one “fragment”. Processing of IPv6 atomic fragments as regular fragmented packets clearly provides an unnecessary vector to perform fragmentation-based attacks against non-fragmented traffic (i.e. IPv6 datagrams that are not really split into multiple pieces but include a Fragment Header).
SOLUTION - The solution is already available in the standards, to make sure IPv6 nodes support RFC6946(opens in a new tab). This establishes that atomic fragments have to be processed in isolation from any other packets and fragments.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  ICMPv6 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


ICMPv6 is used for many IPv6 related protocols, like NDP or MLD. For example, without NDP and its Address Resolution mechanism, it is not possible to discover the layer two address, making it impossible to send a packet to a neighbour or gateway router.
FILTERING WRONGLY ICMPv6 CAN BREAK IPv6

RECOMENDATION WHAT TO DO

RECOMENDATION 1      -The ICMPv6 Specification RFC4443 says that no ICMPv6 error messages should be sent in response to receiving a packet destined to a multicast address. (opens in a new tab)This avoids using ICMPv6 to discover hosts and being used as an amplification attack.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMENDATION 2      -If an ICMPv6 informational message of unknown type is received, it must be silently discarded. This way, ICMPv6 can not be leveraged to discover hosts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMENDATION 3      -An ICMPv6 error message must not originate as a result of receiving the following: A packet sent as a link-layer multicast or as a link-layer broadcast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECOMENDATION 4      -An ICMPv6 error message must not originate as a result of receiving the following: A packet whose source address does not uniquely identify a single node e.g. an IPv6 Unspecified Address, IPv6 multicast address, or an address known by the ICMP message originator as an IPv6 anycast address

TWO EXCEPTIONS        of receiving a packet destined to an IPv6 multicast address or a packet sent as a link-layer multicast or as a link-layer broadcast:
1 EXCEPTION The Packet Too Big Message [RFC4443_section3.2(opens in a new tab)] to allow Path MTU discovery to work for IPv6 multicast.
2 EXCEPTION The Parameter Problem Message, Code 2 [RFC4443_section3.4] reporting an unrecognised IPv6 option [RFC2460_section4.2] that has the Option Type highest-order two bits set to 10.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RECPMENDATION 5      -IPv6 node must limit the rate of the ICMPv6 error messages it originates. This situation may occur when a source sending a stream of erroneous packets fails to listen to the resulting ICMPv6 error messages. 


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


When talking about NDP, it's in the context of a link where attached nodes are neighbors. These nodes could be hosts or routers.
NDP is used on a link for:
• Discovery of available routers and the prefixes and network parameters used (like MTU or default Hop Limit).
• Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), is always used before configuring an address in an interface and to check or verify if the same address is already being used.
• Address Resolution, the equivalent to ARP in IPv4, used to find out the layer two address that corresponds to an IPv6 address.
• Address Autoconfiguration introduces the mechanisms needed to allow nodes to automatically configure an address for an interface.
• Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), used to proactively check if an already known neighbor is still reachable, and refresh its entry in the neighbor cache (link-layer address, etc) before it expires. 
The Neighbor Cache is a table used by IPv6 nodes [RFC4861(opens in a new tab)] about neighbors who have recently been sent traffic. Each entry in the neighbor cache contains the neighbor’s on-link IPv6 unicast address, the link-layer address, an indication if the neighbor is a router or not, the expiration time of the information, and other useful information.

For all these NDP uses, only five messages are defined: 
1. Neighbor Solicitation (NS):    Resolves a neighbor's layer 2 address as part of Address Resolution (destination address is unicast) and also for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
2. Neighbor Advertisement (NA):   Answers an NS message. Quickly propagate new information (unsolicited NA).
3. Router Solicitation (RS) is sent when:   An interface is connected to the network to try to discover if there is any router on the link (router discovery). The destination address used is ff02::2, the multicast address defined for all-routers on the link.
4. Router Advertisement (RA) is sent to:    Answer an RS message. Inform the hosts in the network  periodically about network information and parameters.
5. Redirect is used to:                     Change routing entries on hosts, to send all or part of the traffic to another gateway.

SECURITY of different NDP parts

===========================
NS/NA Threats & Solutions
===========================

1. threat    Neighbor Solicitation (NS) or Neighbor Advertisement (NA) Spoofing [RFC3756].
-- The attacker sends an NS with a changed/wrong “source link-layer” option (the option used to inform other neighbors about a link-layer address).
-- The attacker sends an NA with a changed/wrong “target link-layer” option (the option that includes information about the sender's link-layer).
The sending of the NA could be after seeing an NS sent by a neighbor, or can even be sent in an unsolicited way to explain about a change in information (this is included in the standard and has to be accepted by IPv6 hosts. It is the same in IPv4 with ARP).

In both cases, the attacker gets a wrong entry in the victim's neighbor cache, with a wrong link-layer address. This can be used for a:
• Redirection attack - redirecting the traffic to another host if the link-layer address exists in the network.
• DoS attack - sink all traffic if the specified link-layer address does not exist. 
However, this attack is of limited duration since after 30-50 seconds (with default timer values), the neighbor cache information will expire, discarding the bad link-layer address. The host will try to discover the link-layer address again. As a consequence, the attacker will need to keep responding with fabricated link-layer addresses if they want to maintain the attack beyond the timeout.

By attacking two hosts, an attacker can even achieve a "Man-In-The-Middle" (MITM) attack, making all traffic between the two hosts pass through it.

NS SPOOFING - Let’s start with NS Spoofing to change values in the victim's neighbor cache. If the attacker sends an invalid MAC address (not used in the network) then it will be a DoS attack because traffic will reach no destination at all.     This attack, as almost all the attacks related to NDP, need local access to the network by the attacker.    !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!

NA SPOOFING -  based on sending unsolicited NA messages to the victim. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. threat  Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) Failure     -In this DoS attack, an NA message is used by the attacker to add a wrong link-layer address to the victim's neighbor cache during the NUD process. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. threat   Duplicate Address Detection DoS Attack      -The attacker can make Duplicate Address Detection on other nodes always result in finding a duplicate address. This means that the host who wants to use an address in an interface will always find it is already in use in the network so it can’t be used. If the attacker keeps sending NS/NAs to each DAD attempt, the victim will not be able to configure any address in their interface (not even a link-local). The result is a DoS attack because the victim will not be able to use any address.

SOLUTIION

SOLUTION 1  -  First Hop Security       -First Hop Security (FHS) are security mechanisms for IPv6 implemented on switches. This means layer 2 devices looking at upper layer information. It is called 'first hop' because switches are usually the first device nodes are connected to. There is a number of different techniques that can be considered FHS. They all provide protection to a link or layer two domain, and they need a switch to support them. List of them:

• IPv6 Snooping (ND inspection + DHCPv6 Snooping)
This mechanism inspects NDP and DHCPv6 messages, as well as other IPv6 traffic. It collects information about IP and link-layers addresses seen on each interface. This information is used to create a table binding link-layer and IP addresses per switch port. This binding table can then be used to protect against some attacks, filtering messages that an attacker sends pretending to be another host, for example a spoofed NA message. Note that in order to do this, ICMPv6 level information has to be processed.

• IPv6 Source / Prefix Guard
IPv6 Source/Prefix Guard uses the binding table created by the switch to validate a source address or a prefix of IPv6 traffic sourced from the link. So, in this case, IP layer information is checked against the known information to avoid IP spoofed packets sent from hosts connected to the link. Note that when the binding table is used, the switch will use IPv6 snooping to create it, and then start to provide the IPv6 Source / Prefix Guard protection.

RS/RA Threats & Solutions
===========================

3.2 Malicious Last Hop Router
















• IPv6 Destination Guard (or ND Resolution rate limiter)
• MLD Snooping
• RA-GUARD
• DHCPv6 Guard / DHCPv6 Shield


RECOMENDATIONS
NDP messages should have a Hop Limit of 255. If a different value is found, then the message should be discarded.
Almost all the attacks related with NDP need local access to the network by the attacker.
NDP specification mentions IPsec as a possible security solution, but in practice it is not used. This is because of its complexity and the need of a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), which is not widely used.
The IETF tried to provide a solution to NDP security problems with SEND (Secure Neighbor Discovery) [RFC3971(opens in a new tab)]. This is a standardised extension of NDP to provide security. However, it is not widely available so it cannot be used. 







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Security Devices / Software must process the Full Chain of Headers
--- Firewalls must be able to filter based on Extension Headers - Also, firewalls should be able to deal with the “standard” EHs needed and supported by any IPv6 implementation [RFC8200 section 4(opens in a new tab)]: Hop-by-Hop Options, Fragment, Destination Options, Routing, Authentication (AH), Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). For example, being able to filter packets based on these EHs.


FYI - only the source of the packets could fragment packets. This reduces the possibility of attacks based on overlapping fragments or tiny fragments.
