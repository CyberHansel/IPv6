SOLUTION TO ATTACK

1. IP spoofing           - Ingress filtering and uRPF (unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) to avoid packets coming from a network using addresses identified as not being used on the network. 
2. Covert channel        - type of attack that can use Traffic Class (8 bits) and/or Flow Label (20 bits) to send information against security policies.
                          Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to inspect packets. This allows the inspection of traffic and detects unusual or unexpected values in some fields
